      A: it is nothing but the function that return some piece of jsx or react element 


Write name of the component start with capital letter.

JSX is very Secure 

nested component is called component composition

JSX can only have one parent so to overcome that React.Fragment 
came into the picture and it is like an Empty Tag 
using React.Fragment is looks so ugly so instead of that write empty <> </>

<React.Fragment> < /React.Fragment> === <></>
