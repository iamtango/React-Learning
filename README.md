   cdn links make the project slow

npm use to manage all the package

npm init => create package.json

npm i -D parcel => it is use to install parcel as devdependencies
-D means devdependencies only in the Devlopment Environment
we can install any package without -D that means it for globle Environment
^ (caret) => Auto upgrade to existing version

as soon as any dependencies/devdependencies install then package-lock.json file
and node_module folder created

npm i react => to install the react
npm i react-dom => to install the react-dom

npx means it execute

npx parcel index.html => is to run the parcel to the entry point
as soon as hit above command then dist and .parcel-cache folder created
dist folder keep the file minify for us

npx parcel build index.html => is to run the parcel and make the project production build
and it will minifyall the dile into the dist folder

Polyfill =>is nothing but the code which is replacement for the newer version of the code
(converting the code to the older version of the browser is Called Bable)

<h2> Q: How can u build perfomant web scalable app?</h2>
A: There are so many things React optimise do it for us and so many things bundlers gives us
whole app is the combination of these 2 things.

npm i -D babel-plugin-transform-remove-console => remove the console.logs
in the dist folder which help to minify the code
.babelrc is use for babel configuration.

[Reconcilition](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)

render means updating something into the dom

JSX its use the html inside the js

<h2> Q: what is JSX? </h2>
A: JSX is the html like syntax but it is not html inside js

jsx use React.createElement behind the scene JSX => React.createElement => Object =>HTML(DOM)
babel understand JSX

babel is the compiler next generation js

    // React Compnent
    // Functional  it is NEW
    //  class based component it is OLD

<h2> Q: what is functional component </h2>
A: it is nothing but the function that return some piece of jsx or react element

Write name of the component start with capital letter.

JSX is very Secure

nested component is called component composition

JSX can only have one parent so to overcome that React.Fragment
came into the picture and it is like an Empty Tag
using React.Fragment is looks so ugly so instead of that write empty <> </>

<React.Fragment> < /React.Fragment> === <></>

**_ Config Driven UI _**

Virtual DOM is just not the concept of the react but the concept of the Software Engg concept and react also use it

Virtual DOM => Keeping the reperesntetion of the dom with us.

<h2> Q:Why we need Virtual DOM? </h2>
A: It needed for Reconciliation uses diff algo =>it find diff between Trees (it will only reender the specific portion)

Key help to react that what need to be Updated

React Fiber is the new Reconciliation Engine

Every Compnent in react maintains the state and u can put all the variable into the state

What is state

<h2> Q:what is useState? </h2>
A: It is use to create a state varibales and it comes form react
useState() => it return an array and the first variable of the array is the variable name and second is the function to upadate the variable
syntax :
//local state variable in react

                const [variableName, setVariableName] =useState("Search"); //use the text in param

React says Every time u need ur varibale to be sync with UI Use useState variable.

<h2> Q:what is React hooks?</h2>
    A: it is nothing but the normal function, the are so many hooks and one of the hook we use is useState hook

In the Reconciliation process there is the Diff algo use in it >>> React Fiber is the new reconciliation algorith

rerender the component every time when useState Varibale calls

## Q: Why React is Fast ?

    A: because of the fast dom manupulation, Whenever any changes happened
        in the state then its Quickly rerender everything (everytimes).

### ----------------------------------------------------------------

Monolith >> whole project deploy uding 1 repo

<h2> Q: Microservice Advantages </h2>
    A: Diffrent projects all together,  Easy to maintain,Sepration of concern , no need to depend on some specific Lang.

### Hooks start with use

we can use hooks by simply calling them

2. @Hook >> useEffect Hook > it comes from react Lib

   us can call the function by passing another function in to it and another fuction is CALLBACK function

   use can calll the useEffect() by giving 2 params they are CALLBACK and DEPENDENCY ARRAY.
   if we pass anything into the dependency array then everytime the value is use the useEffect is call

### It is the best place to make API call

by default it will be call once after components render

and if we dont pass any thing in the useEffect hook apart from the callback function it will call every time when the component renders, if we pass dependency arry then it will call only once after render

### optional Chaining >> if data not presend in the perticualr place it help to not get and error

### Shimmer effect which resembless the actual page's UI

by default the length of the page is 0

Don't create (Functional) component inside component, otherwise it will call alot of times

#### Never write your useState Inside the IF..Else or also in Forloop

#### react gives useState hook to use as local variable inside functional component

#### @Never use usestate outside of functional component

#### CDN is the optimalway to store images because it is fast

#### createBrowserRouter it comes from react-router-dom help to create routing{route to perticular page } it takes some configuration(Array){which is the list of path}

#### RouterProvider it comes from react-router-dom help to create routing

root.render rnders whatever u gave so if u want to render acccordingly then use RouterProvider
Syntax:
root.render(< RouterProvider router={createBrowserRouter_const_name}>)

### SPA - Single Page Application

#### There are 2 types of routing

1.Client-side routing
2.Server-side routing =>it is a way that all pages comes from server

#### Links are the another component comes from react-router-dom help to create routing

#### if want to route to another page but also wanted SPA then Import Link from react-router-dom

#### and it is alternative of anchor tag, anchor tag reload the whole page while Link does SPA

#### at the end Link Compoent uses anchor tag behind the scenes

if u have to create nested route u have to create Outlets it comes from react-router-dom
help to keep changing according to the routes

#### all the children written in the createBrowserRouter goes into the outlet

#### useParams is another hook it is use to read the dinamic url parameters

### ----------------------------------------------------------------

<h2> Q: Class Based Components </h2>
 A: It is the easrlier concept it introduce before Hooks and it is very hard to wirte code in early time.
  It is kind of Depricated menthod its alternative is Functional Component

we can create classbased compoent with the help of class keyword and extends React.Component and React.component comes from react
syntax : class {className} extends React.Component
most imp part of the classbased compoent is @Render Method it help to return some JSX code just like functional component

componentDidMount is the method in the classbased component which is the best place to call the API and it will be call after first render
Constructor >> Render >> componentDidMount

componentDidUpdate it will call after every next render

componentWillUnmount use for "cleanUp"

### ----------------------------------------------------------------

### Building our Own Hooks

it is use for useablability, readablelity, easy to maintain

whenever create any hook always make new file and file name start with use

### useState Returns >> target

there is one event listner call Online which help to show the user is offline or not
and is u use any event listner u must need to clean all the event listner because if u use another listner and then back to that normal listner then the new event listner is being call so use "Unmounting"

<h2> Q: How many JS /JSX file parcel produce?</h2>
A: Only one

### One one js file created by bundle but it is bigger projects and has more than 100 components then one-bundle break ur code

so u have to splitting the code or make it in small chunks or "OnDemand Loading"

JUst like useState react also give us lazy which is help for lazy loading it take a function and useful for dynamic import or lazy import
and it is use to create another bundler which help for code chunking
Syntax:
const VARNAME = lazy( ( ) => import("Relative Path") )

react will try to render the things which is not in there so it gives an error so it will suspend the operation

### When u r loading the component on demand react try to sunspend it

Upon OnDemand LOading -> Upon Render -> Suspend Loading
So to avoid the error it uses another component call suspense component and put another component in between
and if the component take long time to load into the app then suspense use props called fallback
Syntax :
< Suspense fallback={< Shimmer />}> < Instamart /> < Suspense/>

#### Never Ever Dynamically load ur component into the the Another Component

### Q: Why we Use Frameworks

A: 1. to Write optimized css, 2. it saves time

[Tailwind Cheatsheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet)

- Why frameworks?

  - optimized css,
  - consistent UI
  - saves time.
  - Eg : MaterialUI, Bootstrap, Base Web UI, Ant design, chakra UI

- Can we use more than one framework ?

  - It's all package can use any number of frameworks,
  - But, not consistent way

- Different ways to write css :

  1. **Normal Native CSS** - all components's styles in a single file index.css
  2. **SCSS** - Syntactical CSS - atlast it is converted to css
  3. **Inline CSS** - style attribute - pass object - {{backgroundColor : "red"}}
  4. **Component Library** - MaterialUI, Bootstrap, Base Web UI, Ant design, chakra UI
  5. **CSS Framework** - Tailwind
  6. **Styled Components**: Majorly used in react projects.

- **Important**: In a `system design round of interview`, you always have to discuss that

  - what will you use for styling your components?
  - Now, there are differnet ways, you can style your web apps.
  - But, what way you will choose & you have give a a good reason for it.
  - So, you should know what are the pros & cons of using them.
  - Exapmle: what are pros & cons of using `Native CSS` over `SCSS` or `component library`

- Pros & Cons of using Component librery (i.e MaterialUI, Bootstrap, etc)

  - Pros :

    - `consistent UI`: (All the button in your app will look the same now)
    - save time

  - Cons :
    - Bundle size -
    - Loose control over design
    - personal customizition is hard

### Tailwind CSS:

- When? How? & Why? to use it.

- writing css on the go (i.e in the same file )
- reusablity
- less bundle size (minimal css) only includes the css classes that we have used
- Flexible UI (Customizable)

  PROS: Easy to use, More Reuseablitit, code is less, no duplicate css, fast time, easy to debug
  CONS: Heavy Bundle Size

It's comes with some predefined configuration and same need to configure in project. Different Framework or library have it's own configuration like parcels and Angular comes with difference configuration. For Detailed knowladge follow the tailwind documentation.

how to put Tailwind
using cdn links in index.js file

Install Tailwindcss Using Parcel
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss
npx tailwindcss init >> it make tailwind.config.js

In the tailwind.config.js file "content" array is use so that tailwind know that only these extension file be executed

### postcssrc we have to create so that our bundler know that we use tailwind css so it can compile

In short 'it compile Tailwind Css into normal css'

when we write tailwind css we dont write any css in css file just write
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

use extension tailwindcss intellisense

use [] =>Square bracet notesion for the precious or exact value or dynamic value
example: w-[200px]

### ------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div align="center"> <h2> Data is the New Oil</h2> </div>

UI Layer < Data Layer (UI Layer | Data Layer)

### Q: In UI what does data layer consist of ?

A:It Manges by State and props

### Q: Diffrence Between State And Props ?

    A: State can be change where Props cannot be change
        State which in the local variable
        Props are somethings whoes value can be pass from one element component to the another
        Props are kind of local state variable to the parent component
        # Props is something which is recieving inside the component

### PROPS DRILLING => drilling props from top to bottom level

React dev tools extension in chrome
showing whole tree in chrome

accessing parents property into child is called PROPS Drilling
and we can access child property by using custom hooks

### useContext is the normal hook

### React context is use for piece of data use anywhere in the app and it is normal function

u can create multiple context in the app

Props And state are tied to the compoent but React Context is not tied to the component

<UserContext.Consumer>
<UserContext.Provider>

### React routing also done with the help of context

#only for debugging
Writing a name to the context provider is good and remove the comfusion if had more context in the app so use
put the .displayName method
ex: userConetxt.displayName = "Name_Which_want_to_display";

### We use Contex to avoid Prop Drilling

Asume Contex like a outer garage where u store cars and can be use

### Any component of ur app can be access and can be modify the context

ex : theme (dark and light)

### ------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div align="center"> <h2>  Lets Build our Store</h2> </div>

### Redux

It help to manage Data Layer of our Application
It burden to use context for the large scalable app so Redux come into the picture

When u use to build small app then context u have to use otherwise redux

### It is complicated library so it come with REDUX TOOLKIT

<summary>Advantage of using Redux Toolkit over Redux.</summary><br>
<blockquote>

1. `Abstraction and Convenience:` Redux Toolkit provides a set of abstractions and conveniences on top of regular Redux, which make it easier to work with and manage the state of your application. This includes features such as the `createSlice` function for creating slices of state and its associated `actions and reducer`, and the `createStore` function for creating a `Redux store` with pre-configured middleware and enhancers.

2. `Immutable updates:` Regular Redux requires you to create a `new state object` every time you make an update, which can become repetitive and error-prone. Redux Toolkit provides a way to `update the state immutably`, using its built-in `createSlice` function.

3. `Simplified Reducers:` In regular Redux, you write your `own reducers`, which can become complex and difficult to manage as your application grows. With Redux Toolkit, you can use the `createSlice` function to generate reducers for you, based on the state updates you define.

4. `Improved Performance:` Redux Toolkit uses advanced performance optimizations, such as memoization, lazy evaluation, and selective updates, to make your application faster and more efficient.

5. `Better Debugging:` Redux Toolkit provides better debugging tools, such as the ability to log and replay actions, inspect the current state of your application, and easily track the changes made to your state over time.

<summary>Explain Dispatcher.</summary><br>
<blockquote>

A dispatcher is a `function` that dispatches actions to the store. In Redux, actions are used to describe changes to the state, and dispatching an action is the way to trigger those changes.

- How to create & use dispatcher function ?

```
const dispatch = useDispatch();
```

This hook returns a reference to the `dispatch function` from the `Redux` store. You may use it to dispatch actions as needed.

```
dispatch(actionCreator(data)); // returns an action payload object
```

When you dispatch an action creator, it returns an `action object` that the `reducer function` uses to update the `state`. The dispatcher function is used to dispatch the action creator and which in turns calls the reducer function to trigger the update.

</blockquote><br>
</details>

<!-- *******************************-->
<details>
<summary>Explain Reducer.</summary><br>
<blockquote>

A reducer is a `pure function` in Redux that takes the `current state` of your application and an `action`, and returns a `new state` based on that `action`.

Example :

```javascript
addItem: (state, action) => {
   const item = state.items[action.payload.id];
   const quantity = item && item.hasOwnProperty('quantity')
     ? state.items[action.payload.id]?.quantity + 1 : 1;
   state.items[action.payload.id] = { ...action.payload, quantity };
   state.totalItemsCount = state.totalItemsCount + 1;
},
```

Here based on the action object, the state is updated inside teh reducer function.

<details>
<summary>Explain slice.</summary><br>
<blockquote>

In Redux Toolkit, a `slice` is a piece of the state that is managed by a single set of actions and reducer.

</blockquote><br>
</details>

<!-- *******************************-->
<details>
<summary>Explain selector.</summary><br>
<blockquote>

- A `selector` is a pure `function` that takes the current `state` of your application and returns a derived value based on that state.

- `useSelector` is a hook from the `react-redux` library that allows you to `subscribe` to the `state` of your Redux store from a React component.
- The `useSelector` hook takes a `selector function` as its argument, which is used to extract data from the state tree.
- The component will re-render whenever the state of your Redux store changes and the derived value returned by the selector function changes.

```javascript
const totalItemsCount = useSelector((store) => store.cart.totalItemsCount);
```

`store => store.cart.totalItemsCount` is the selector function which _returns_ the `totalItemsCount` from the _state_.
Now, useSelector() is used to subscribe to this totalItemsCount from the state.

</blockquote><br>
</details>

<!-- *******************************-->
<details>
<summary>Explain createSlice and the configuration it takes.</summary><br>
<blockquote>

The `createSlice` function is used to create a store slice, a piece of the store.

The `createSlice` function takes an `object` as an argument, which contains the following properties:

- `name:` A string that represents the name of the slice.
- `initialState:` An `object` that represents the `initial state` of the slice. In our cartSlice example, the initial state is an object with two properties: `items` (an empty object) and `totalItemsCount` (which is 0).
- `reducers:` An `object` that contains the Redux reducers for the slice. Reducers are functions that take the current `state` and an `action`, and return a new state based on the action type and payload. In our example, there are three reducers: addItem, removeItem, and clearCart.

After creating the slice, the code `exports` the `actions` that can be dispatched on the store. In this example, there are three actions: addItem, removeItem, and clearCart.

Finally, the code `exports` the `reducer` for the slice using the reducer property of the slice. The reducer is responsible for managing the state of the slice and updating it in response to dispatched actions.

<!-- *******************************-->

redux store is nothing but the big Object which has small section

@Dispatch
@Slicer
@Reducer
@Selector `Subscribing`

if u click on the + button of the store it will dispatches an action which calls reducer function which update slice of redux store

- Button >>Dispatching Action >> Reducer function >> Slice redux store >> Selector

When we click on Add Button, we dispatch an action, which calls a reducer function, which updates the slice of the store & for reading data, we subscribe the store. Then, it automagically updates.

Selector is Hook

npm i @reduxjs/toolkit >> to install the Redux Library >> It is the core of redux
npm i react-redux >> it is bridge between react and redux

configureStore()

provider help to connect the store with app
createSlice

createSlice
name
initialState
reducers
addItem
clearCart
Reducer contain Mapping of action and reducer function

### useSelector hook is very good hook it will directly give access to the store It is help to SUBSCRIBE

Subscribing to the specific store

useDispacth come from react-redux

## Redux === context

Redux devtool Extension IMP if u work in redux

How to test ur react application

### React Testing Library

### Q: Why we need Test Cases ?

A: To check the performace of code
1.Adding new functionality will not break existing functionality

@ Test Driven Development

### JEST = Javascript Testing Framework

### jest find the test cases writtin in the file

Install Testing Library
npm i --save-dev @testing-library/react
npm i -D jest
configure jest by creating jest.config file
-> npx jest --init
npm run jest
npm i -D jest-environment-jsdom
Create my first test - create ne folder with the name "** tests**"
naming convention for writing the test cases with ".test.js"
Configure jest with babel
-> npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env  
 -[JEST Configure doc](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started#using-babel)
Write some text cases
then npm run test
-gitignore Coverage report

.babelrc >> require JSON data not JS file data

we r not running testcases into the browser we write test case to run on jsdom
JSDOM is the mini Browser(some functionality)

render use in the .test.js file help to load perticual portion and we write just like we like for the whole app
this library comes form the @testing-library/react

Install npm i -D @babel/preset-react
JEST does not understand jsx so to understand write
["@babel/preset-react",{"runtime" : "automatic"}] in babelrc file it help JEST to read JSX

jest doesnot able to read png file so in jest config file moduleNameMapper will help

staticRouter comes from reacr-router-dom/server

data-testid
@getAllByTestId

fetch is not understand by the jest use
global.fetch = jest.fn()

expect().toBe

### watch-test : "jest --watch" Help not to write again an again like HMR

Install
npm i -D @testing-library/jest-dom

<div align="center"> <h2>The End Game => Live Chat</h2> </div>
### Topics Coverd:-

While creating `youtube clone` covered:

- Built YouTube `Live Chat` functionality.
- Challengs faced:
  - `Data Layer`: How to get Live Data using `API Polling`?
  - `UI Layer`: Why is browser page `not freezing`?
- `Web Socket` Vs `API Polling` (Long Polling)
- Demo of `useMemo()`
- Overview of `useCallback()`
- Demo of `useRef()`

### Live Data

#### Web Socket => Hand Shake

                  Ex : Trading Platforms, Whatapp {Nearly Realtime}

#### API Polling

                  Ex : Gmail, Cricbuzz {Time in Interview}

## New Hooks

#### UseMemo -> Increase the Performance `Cache the Results` Optimizing the code

#### UseCallback -> `Cache the Function`

#### UseRef -> `Let refrence a Value that's not needd to Rerendering` Update the Value but not want to rerender `Return Object`

#### Normal Var VS State Variable -> Normal Varibale not render the page but state can and Normal Variable can be start from the start if give pause for while but state will resume from the previous value and if we dont want to reset the value set in normal Var then use UseRef it will resume
